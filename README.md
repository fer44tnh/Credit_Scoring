# ðŸ’¼ Credit Scoring and Survival Analysis Project

## ðŸ“˜ Project Summary

This project was completed as part of a Master's-level individual assignment in credit scoring. In the scenario, I was hired as a **data scientist by a financial institution** specializing in loans to subprime customers. The institution provided anonymized datasets of both accepted and rejected loan applicants and tasked me with developing a robust **application credit scorecard** to optimize credit risk decisions.

In addition, I performed a **survival analysis** to understand default behavior over time using a second dataset, `mortgage.csv`, which includes borrower and economic indicators.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

### Part 1: Credit Scoring
- Develop a credit scorecard from anonymized applicant data.
- Incorporate **reject inference** to address bias from rejected applicants.
- Use **Weight of Evidence (WoE)** encoding and analyze the number of bins.
- Compare classification models and justify final selection.
- Evaluate performance using industry-standard metrics.
- Minimize expected **operational risk** and **cost of default**:
  - **Loss Given Default (LGD):** 75%
  - **Risk-Free Rate:** 1.5%
- Ensure the process is fully documented and reproducible.

### Part 2: Survival Analysis
- Evaluate **time to default** based on outstanding balance at loan origination.
- Compare survival probabilities at **25** and **50** months for low vs. average/high balances.
- Fit a **Cox Proportional Hazards model** with time-varying covariates.
- Interpret the impact of macroeconomic variables on default risk.

## ðŸ“Š Key Results

### Credit Scoring:
- Developed an interpretable scorecard using logistic regression.
- Integrated reject inference to reduce selection bias.
- Optimized cutoff threshold based on cost minimization.
- Demonstrated strong discriminatory power via AUC, KS, and Gini metrics.

### Survival Analysis:
- Identified significant differences in survival probabilities between groups.
- Found that economic indicators (GDP, unemployment rate, etc.) significantly impact default timing.
- Cox model provided interpretable hazard ratios for policy formulation.
